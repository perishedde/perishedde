# What do I look for!?

I'm looking for a cool charitable project that I can support in my spare time. If there are any open source software projects focused on saving our planet and/or stopping global warming that need help and/or some assistance then please don't be afraid to contact me. If you have a cool idea of what fantastic technological solutions can save our planet, don't hesitate... Maybe we can make the world a little better together...

# Some ideas to safe the planet

## Merge waste management companies and private households - As a planet-wide open source model

Many valuable raw materials end up in normal household waste and are burned in the waste incineration plant or piled up on rubbish dumps. What if we reuse these raw materials and recycle them as completely as possible? I imagine an app that, similar to dating apps, creates matches between waste disposal companies and private households. Garbage is not always worthless. In this way, valuable raw materials could be bought out of the garbage in private households by the disposal companies. I would also like to refine this idea with anyone who is interested in this approach.

## The open source "CO2 vacuum cleaner"

I imagine a machine that sucks CO2 out of the atmosphere without harming the atmosphere or the biosphere. A biologist would smile at this point and say that this machine already exists: a tree. But since governments have not stopped cutting down our planet's forests and forest fires have destroyed huge areas of forest, we need an alternative. We need mechanical engineers, chemists, electrical engineers and computer scientists to solve the problem now. The CO2 has to be sucked out of the atmosphere and compressed into small stackable blocks. In a further step, the CO2 blocks could be transported to the sun. That all sounds a little crazy, but I am also happy to receive suggestions for improvement.
