I'm a developer from Verlbert (Germany). The technology stack I'm currently working on is...

* Flutter / Dart
* Java / Spring Boot
* Python / Django

# What do I look for!?

I'm looking for a cool charitable project that I can support in my spare time. If there are any open source software projects focused on saving our planet and/or stopping global warming that need help and/or some assistance then please don't be afraid to contact me. If you have a cool idea of what fantastic technological solutions can save our planet, don't hesitate... Maybe we can make the world a little better together...
